## Libraries and Constants

The code includes the necessary libraries, such as Trade and MovingAverages, to execute trading operations. It also defines two constants, TP_DISTANCE and SL_DISTANCE, which represent the take profit and stop loss distances in pips.

```cpp
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
#include <MovingAverages\MovingAverages.mqh>
#define TP_DISTANCE 50     // Take Profit distance in pips
#define SL_DISTANCE 30     // Stop Loss distance in pips
```

## Trading Functions

### `isTrending()`

This function implements advanced algorithms to identify market trends. It returns `true` if the market is trending and `false` otherwise.

```cpp
bool isTrending()
{
    // Implement advanced algorithms to identify market trends
    // and return true if market is trending, else false
}
```

### `analyzeMarket()`

This function analyzes market data and identifies potential trading opportunities. It calls the `isTrending()` function and implements logic based on large volumes of market data.

```cpp
void analyzeMarket()
{
    if (isTrending())
    {
        // Implement analysis logic to identify potential trading opportunities
        // based on large volumes of market data
    }
}
```

### `placeBuyTrade()`

This function executes a buy trade using the CTrade class. It sets customizable parameters for lot size and other trade settings. The take profit and stop loss levels are set based on the TP_DISTANCE and SL_DISTANCE constants. It also prints a success message after placing the trade.

```cpp
void placeBuyTrade()
{
    // Implement code to execute a buy trade using the CTrade class
    // with customizable parameters for lot size and other trade settings
    // Set Take Profit and Stop Loss levels based on TP_DISTANCE and SL_DISTANCE
    // Print a success message after placing the trade
}
```

### `placeSellTrade()`

This function executes a sell trade using the CTrade class. It sets customizable parameters for lot size and other trade settings. The take profit and stop loss levels are set based on the TP_DISTANCE and SL_DISTANCE constants. It also prints a success message after placing the trade.

```cpp
void placeSellTrade()
{
    // Implement code to execute a sell trade using the CTrade class
    // with customizable parameters for lot size and other trade settings
    // Set Take Profit and Stop Loss levels based on TP_DISTANCE and SL_DISTANCE
    // Print a success message after placing the trade
}
```

## Main Entry Point

The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the program. It calls the `analyzeMarket()` function to identify trading opportunities. It then checks if a buy or sell trade can be placed based on certain conditions. If a trade is viable, it calls the corresponding trade function.

```cpp
void OnStart()
{
    // Analyze market data to identify trading opportunities
    analyzeMarket();
    
    // Check if a buy trade can be placed
    if (/* condition to check if a buy trade is viable */)
    {
        placeBuyTrade();
    }
    
    // Check if a sell trade can be placed
    if (/* condition to check if a sell trade is viable */)
    {
        placeSellTrade();
    }
}
```
